/**
 * Configuration for the optional foreground service notification.
 *
 * When enabled via `startScanning(foregroundScanConfig)`, a persistent notification
 * is shown while the SDK scans in background. This keeps the process alive on
 * aggressive OEMs (Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung) that may kill PendingIntent scans.
 *
 * **Notification title**: defaults to the host app name (resolved at runtime).
 * Pass an empty string `""` to use the app name, or provide a custom title.
 *
 * **Notification text**: defaults to "Scanning for nearby content".
 * This text is shown when the service starts. Once beacons are detected,
 * the SDK calls [BearoundTelemetrySDKListener.onProvideNotificationContent] so the host
 * app can return contextual text (e.g., "Offers available nearby!").
 *
 * Examples of creative notification messages:
 * - "Looking for nearby deals"
 * - "Discovering what's new around you"
 * - "Connecting you to nearby experiences"
 * - "Tracking exclusive offers in your area"
