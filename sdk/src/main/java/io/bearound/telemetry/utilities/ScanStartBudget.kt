/**
 * Preventive guard for the OS BLE scan-start quota (5 starts per 30 s per app — exceeding it
 * leaves the scan client registered but permanently SILENT, with no error on most versions).
 *
 * The SDK's duty cycle alone runs at 4 starts/30 s in MEDIUM precision; its own side events
 * (watchdog restarts, batch revive, foreground↔background flips, region enter) consume the
 * remaining headroom and silently starve scanners in perfectly normal usage. Every internal
 * `startScan` call must pass through [tryAcquire]; callers that get `false` should SKIP this
 * start and let their natural retry (duty cycle tick / watchdog / liveness) re-attempt —
 * skipping one cycle is recoverable, a starved client is not.
 *
 * [freeze] implements the cool-off demanded by `SCAN_FAILED_SCANNING_TOO_FREQUENTLY`
 * (Android 11+): all starts are denied until the freeze elapses.
