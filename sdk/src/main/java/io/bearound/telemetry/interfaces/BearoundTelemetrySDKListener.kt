 * Listener interface for SDK events and updates.
 *
 * Threading contract: all callbacks are dispatched on the main (UI) thread, so it is safe
 * to update UI directly from any of them without extra thread hopping. The only exception is
 * [onProvideNotificationContent], which is invoked synchronously on the SDK's scan thread
 * because the SDK consumes its return value inline — keep that implementation lightweight and
 * off the UI toolkit.
 *
 * v2.2: Added sync lifecycle and background detection callbacks
